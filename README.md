- If a King disconnects from the game, another King will be assigned randomly between team players.
- The Usurper always loses, he can kill everyone (but not close to a team's spawn) and if he kills a King he becomes one, making the old King the new Usurper. Also Usurper has two arrows pointing towards each King's position.
- Each player name color will be the same as the team color.
- There are custom messages for match duration, captured zone, a King died or a King disconnects, also the game score is always displayed.

## HotPotato

A random player gets the Hot Potato role, that player has to give the hot potato to another player before the time runs out, otherwise the hot potato player will die. It can be only 1 Hot Potato on the game, the rest will be Cold Potato or Burnt Potato if they died. This gamemode also works as Hide and Seek gamemode because Cold Potato will try to hide from the Hot Potato, I highly recommend to play it on MiraHQ.

| Option  | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Hot Potato Time Limit | Time before the Hot Potato explodes |
| Hot Potato Cooldown | Give Hot Potato Cooldown |
| Cold Potatoes Vision | Light range for Cold Potato players |
| Reset Hot Potato timer after Transfer | Hot Potato Time Limit doesn't reset |
| Extra Time when timer doesn't reset | Hot Potato Extra Time Limit if it doesn't reset |

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**
- First round doesn't have a time limit, this way when the Hot Potato transfers for the first time, every player get the timer synchronized.
- Each player name color will be the same as the team color.
- Only Hot Potato player can use vents.
- Nobody can kill on this gamemode.
- Hot Potato player will have a potato above his player.
- When the Hot Potato explodes or disconnects from the game, another random alive player will get the Hot Potato role.
- Giving the Hot Potato to another player makes that player unable to move for the next 3 seconds, also Hot Potato Time Limit resets.
- There are custom messages for match duration, who is the Hot Potato, how many Cold Potatoes are alive and time for giving the Hot Potato.

-----------------------

## Zombie Laboratory

A random player gets the Zombie role, another player the Nurse role and the rest will be Survivors. The zombie must infect everyone to win, while the survivors have to look for the key items hided in boxes around the map to give them to the Nurse so she can make the cure and win the game. This gamemode adds a new zone on the map, the Infirmary. If timer reach 0, zombie team will win.

| Option  | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Initial Zombies | Initial spawned zombie players, from 1 to 5 |
| Time needed to Infect | Time needed next to a player to infect it |
| Infect Cooldown | Infect Button Cooldown |
| Search Box Timer | Time needed to search inside a Box |
| Time limit to use medkit | Nurse time limit to use medkit on a infected player |
| Who Can Zombies Kill | Survivors only, all (including Nurse) or nobody |

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**
- Only Zombies can use vents.
- Zombies can infect other player by standing near to him the needed time. Infected players name will turn from blue to yellow but they remain as Survivor during the time limit to use medkit.
- If the time to use medkit reach 0 (this timer is only visible for Survivor team), that Survivor will turn into a Zombie.
- Nurse is immune to the infection, she can pick a medkit (pointed by pink arrows) from 3 different map location and use it on a infected player (yellow name) to cure it or on a zombie to kill it. She can carry only 1 medkit at once and will lose it if she gets killed. A healed player will have a pink screen flash, and everyone will hear a heal sound, also that player has to be infected again to try to turn it into a zombie. The Nurse gets a permanent speed and vision boost if Survivors delivered 3 or more key items.
- Infirmary is the Nurse's spawn and only survivors can enter in it. After 10 seconds, survivors will be forced to exit it. The Nurse can enter and stay in it anytime she wants, also she can leave from 3 different location to prevent Zombie spawn camping. There's 2 switches in the Infirmary, the left one is for delivering a key item and the right one is to create the cure when all key items are delivered, making the Survivor team the winner.
- Survivors have to look for the key items hided in the boxes around the map and deliver them to the Infirmary.
- Zombies can kill (but not close to the Infirmaty), and the Survivors can find ammo on random boxes, which makes them able to kill 1 time (after being killed or killing a Zombie they will have to search the same ammo box to recharge their kill button)
- Boxes loot are random for every player even the location is the same for everyone. There are 60 box on every map, 6 of them contains the key items, 4 contains ammo and the rest are empty. For example Survivor 1 can find ammo on Admin while Survivor 2 finds it on Reactor, the same goes with the key items. 
- If you're delivering a key item, you can't search boxes or kill and you'll lose it if you die or turn into a zombie, making the key item return to their original location.
- If a Zombie disconnects from the game and was the only one, survivors will win. Also if the Nurse disconnects, zombie team will win.
- There are custom messages for somebody gets infected, delivered a key item or someone turned into a zombie.
- Score message is always shown, telling how many key items had been delivered, how many survivors are alive, how many infected are and how many zombies are.

## BattleRoyale

On this gamemode everyone has a ranged kill button with the Archer's mechanic (usable with right mouse clic) and a very low cooldown. Players have lifes and when they reach 0 lifes they die for the rest of the match, the last one alive wins. Also there are 3 ways of playing this gamemode, which are detailed below. 

| Option  | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Match Type | All VS All, Team Battle or Score Battle |
| Kill Cooldown | Kill Button Cooldown |
| Fighter Lifes | Number of Lifes the players have |
| Score Number | Total Score for winning on Score Battle |

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**
- Nobody can vent.
- If the time reaches 0, all alive players will win (except on Score Battle).
- All VS All is an individual deathmatch where players spawn on 15 different selected spawn points (this doesn't apply to Airship or Submerged) and the last alive player wins.
- Team Battle is a team deathmatch between 2 teams (lime and pink with 7 max players) where the team that kill the enemy team first wins.
- Score Battle is the same as Team Battle but instead of permadeath, players revive and gain points each time they kill someone, upon reaching the needed score they win. You get 10 points for killing anyone and 30 points if you kill the neutral role detailed below.
- On odd player number games for Team and Score Battle there will be a powerful neutral role called Serial Killer which act as a solo team player that can also win killing everyone or reaching the needed score. This role has x2 lifes (x3 lifes on games with 11 or more players) and half kill cooldown.
- Player's lifes are shown after their names but you can't see other player's remaining lifes. On the other hand, on Team and Score Battle you can see your teammates remaining lifes, also you can't hit or kill your teammates.
- The ranged kill can't go across walls or other collision props like the Archer's impostor role and if you miss the shot it just enters cooldown. Also a straight line player color based will appear everytime you shoot to serve as guidance.
- You will hear a sound if you hit someone or you get hit. Also there's a special bell sound when someone dies on All VS All or Team Battle.
- Player's color ground splashes will appear when someone gets hit on All VS All, on Team and Score Battle they will be lime, pink or grey. It will stay there the entire match except for Score Battle, where it disappears after 5 seconds.

-----------------------

## MonjaFestival

Match between green and cyan teams where each team has to look for Monjas around the map and deliver them to their base. When the time reaches 0, the team with more Monjas wins. On odd player number games a special role called Big Monja will appear.

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**
- There are 6 Monjas spawns on the map where players can pick up Monjas, two of them have more Monjas to pick than the other four.
- The amount of Monjas that can be picked from the spawns reloads within time.
- Each player name color will be the same as the team color.
- Each player can only carry 3 Monjas at the same time, delivering to the base gives 1 point for each Monja, but the player drops them on the floor if he gets killed.
- Everyone can kill (while not carrying Monjas), nobody can vent or steal Monjas from the other team's base.
- A random Allul's Monja might spawn randomly somewhere on the map, picking it up gives 10 points to the team who found it.
- Big Monja is a neutral role that plays on its own, she can pick up to 10 Monjas at the same time faster than anyone, has less kill cooldown, can vent, became invisible for a short time and steal Monjas from other's team base, without any kind of punishment from carrying Monjas. On the other hand she can be killed while invisible.
- There are custom messages for match duration, who found Allul's Monja and if the neutral role is stealing from your team's base.

# CustomCosmetics

A custom hats system (adapted from [xxomega77](https://github.com/xxomega77xx/HatPack)) has been added, also thanks to that I could add a method to add custom visors and nameplates too. It can have some color or position bugs, we'll try to fix them in the future while also adding new cosmetics.

-----------------------

# Submerged

From Las Monjas 1.5.0 version, [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged) is included on the modpack and can be played either on roles game or any gamemodes. When a Submerged update is available, a cyan button will appear on the bottom-left on the main menu to update Submerged. There's still a few changes when playing on Submerged exclusively:
- Custom arrows points towards the closest Elevator if the target is on the other floor.
- Central vents (the ones on the glass floor) can be used only by impostor roles. Any crewmate who can vent won't be able to use them.
- Mimic has a visual bug, if you're transformed into other player and get out of a vent, the hat (if it's adaptative) goes back to its original color, but its only a visual bug for the Mimic player, meaning other players still see the correct hat color.
- Challenger's arena has a visual bug, players won't see the others on the other floor.
- Mechanic can't fix O2 sabotage since it affects the players individually.
- Time traveler's rewind makes the players go back to the central area on both floors instead going back in time.
- Welder can't seal central vents or the one-way vent + its exit.
- Spiritualist and Necromancer revive point is fixed to Medbey on the upper floor and security on the lower one, instead the body's location.
- Vigilant can't put extra cameras, only check them remotely.
- Archer only gets aim assist for the players on the same floor as him.
- Ninja can't use Ninja Time if his target is on the other floor.
- Puppeteer initial transform position gets replaced by Medbey on the upper floor and security on the lower one.
- Seeker's arena has a visual bug, players won't see the others on the other floor.
- Jailer's spawns two prison, one for each floor.
- All gamemodes use both floors, there's two revive points based on the player's floor and central vents can't be used.

-----------------------
